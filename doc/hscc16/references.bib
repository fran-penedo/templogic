The logic is based on a bounded subset of the real-time logic mitl, augmented with a static mapping from continuous domains into propositions. From formulae in this logic we create automatically property monitors that can check whether a given signal of bounded length and finite variability satisfies the property. A prototype implementation of this procedure was used to check properties of simulation traces generated by Matlab/Simulink.},

Namely, given a parametric specification, we would like to automatically infer the ranges of parameters for which the property holds/does not hold on the system. In this paper, we consider parametric specifications in Metric Temporal Logic (MTL). Using robust semantics for MTL, the parameter estimation problem can be converted into an optimization problem which can be solved by utilizing stochastic optimization methods. The framework is demonstrated on some examples from the literature.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an inference algorithm that can discover temporal logic properties of a system from data. Our algorithm operates on finite time system trajectories that are labeled according to whether or not they demonstrate some desirable system properties (e.g. "the car successfully stops before hitting an obstruction"). A temporal logic formula that can discriminate between the desirable behaviors and the undesirable ones is constructed. The formulae also indicate possible causes for each set of behaviors (e.g. "If the speed of the car is greater than 15 m/s within 0.5s of brake application, the obstruction will be struck") which can be used to tune designs or to perform on-line monitoring to ensure the desired behavior. We introduce reactive parameter signal temporal logic (rPSTL), a fragment of parameter signal temporal logic (PSTL) that is expressive enough to capture causal, spatial, and temporal relationships in data. We define a partial order over the set of rPSTL formulae that is based on language inclusion. This order enables a directed search over this set, i.e. given a candidate rPSTL formula that does not adequately match the observed data, we can automatically construct a formula that will fit the data at least as well. Two case studies, one involving a cattle herding scenario and one involving a stochastic hybrid gene circuit model, are presented to illustrate our approach.},

  abstract = {Stochastic models such as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC) and Stochastic Hybrid Automata (SHA) are powerful formalisms to model and to reason about the dynamics of biological systems, due to their ability to capture the stochasticity inherent in biological processes. A classical question in formal modelling with clear relevance to biological modelling is the model checking problem, i.e. calculate the probability that a behaviour, expressed for instance in terms of a certain temporal logic formula, may occur in a given stochastic process. However, one may not only be interested in the notion of satisfiability, but also in the capacity of a system to maintain a particular emergent behaviour unaffected by the perturbations, caused e.g. from extrinsic noise, or by possible small changes in the model parameters. To address this issue, researchers from the verification community have recently proposed several notions of robustness for temporal logic providing suitable definitions of distance between a trajectory of a (deterministic) dynamical system and the boundaries of the set of trajectories satisfying the property of interest. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we extend the notion of robustness to stochastic systems, showing that this naturally leads to a distribution of robustness degrees. By discussing three examples, we show how to approximate the distribution of the robustness degree and the average robustness. Secondly, we show how to exploit this notion to address the system design problem, where the goal is to optimise some control parameters of a stochastic model in order to maximise robustness of the desired specifications.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of model checking stochastic systems, i.e., checking whether a stochastic system satisfies a certain temporal property with a probability greater (or smaller) than a fixed threshold. In particular, we present a Statistical Model Checking (SMC) approach based on Bayesian statistics. We show that our approach is feasible for a certain class of hybrid systems with stochastic transitions, a generalization of Simulink/Stateflow models. Standard approaches to stochastic discrete systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems and quickly become infeasible with larger state spaces. Generalizations of these techniques to hybrid systems with stochastic effects are even more challenging. The SMC approach was pioneered by Younes and Simmons in the discrete and non-Bayesian case. It solves the verification problem by combining randomized sampling of system traces (which is very efficient for Simulink/Stateflow) with hypothesis testing (i.e., testing against a probability threshold) or estimation (i.e., computing with high probability a value close to the true probability). We believe SMC is essential for scaling up to large Stateflow/Simulink models. While the answer to the verification problem is not guaranteed to be correct, we prove that Bayesian SMC can make the probability of giving a wrong answer arbitrarily small. The advantage is that answers can usually be obtained much faster than with standard, exhaustive model checking techniques. We apply our Bayesian SMC approach to a representative example of stochastic discrete-time hybrid system models in Stateflow/Simulink: a fuel control system featuring hybrid behavior and fault tolerance. We show that our technique enables faster verification than state-of-the-art statistical techniques. We emphasize that Bayesian SMC is by no means restricted to Stateflow/Simulink models. It is in principle applicable to a variety of stochastic models from other domains, e.g., systems biology.},

  abstract = {Formal verification of a control system can be performed by checking if a model of its dynamical behavior conforms to temporal requirements. Unfortunately, adoption of formal verification in an industrial setting is a formidable challenge as design requirements are often vague, non-modular, evolving, or sometimes simply unknown. We propose a framework to mine requirements from a closed-loop model of an industrialscale control system, such as one specified in Simulink. The input to our algorithm is a requirement template expressed in Parametric Signal Temporal Logic: a logical formula in which concrete signal or time values are replaced with parameters. Given a set of simulation traces of the model, our method infers values for the template parameters to obtain the strongest candidate requirement satisfied by the traces. It then tries to falsify the candidate requirement using a falsification tool. If a counterexample is found, it is added to the existing set of traces and these steps are repeated; otherwise, it terminates with the synthesized requirement. Requirement mining has several usage scenarios: mined requirements can be used to formally validate future modifications of the model, they can be used to gain better understanding of legacy models or code, and can also help enhancing the process of bug-finding through simulations. We demonstrate the scalability and utility of our technique on three complex case studies in the domain of automotive powertrain systems: a simple automatic transmission controller, an air-fuel controller with a mean-value model of the engine dynamics, and an industrial-size prototype airpath controller for a diesel engine. We include results on a bug found in the prototype controller by our method.},

This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks.},
