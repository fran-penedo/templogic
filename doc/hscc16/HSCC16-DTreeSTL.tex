% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{4} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces a framework for inference of timed temporal logic properties from data. The data is given as a finite set of pairs of finite-time system trajectories and labels, where the labels indicate whether the trajectories exhibit some desired behavior (e.g. a ship traveling along a safe route).
We propose a decision-tree based approach for learning signal temporal logic classifiers. The method grows binary decision trees which represent the inferred formulae. Each node of a tree is associated with a simple formula chosen from a finite, pre-definite set of parameterized \emph{primitive} formulae.
A new node is created by finding the optimal primitive together
with its parameters.  Optimality is assessed using heuristic \emph{impurity} measures, which capture how well the current primitive splits the data
with respect to the trajectories' labels.
\Rkeep{We propose extensions of the usual impurity measures from machine learning literature to handle classification of finite-time system trajectories by leveraging upon the \emph{robustness degree} concept.}
The proposed incremental construction procedure greatly improves
the execution time and the accuracy compared to existing algorithms.
We present two case studies that illustrate the usefulness and the computational advantages of the algorithms. The first is an anomalous trajectory detection problem in a maritime environment. The second is a fault detection problem in an automotive powertrain system.
